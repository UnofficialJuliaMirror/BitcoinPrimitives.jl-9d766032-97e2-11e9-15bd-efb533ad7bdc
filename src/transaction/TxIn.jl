    TxIn

Each non-coinbase input spends an outpoint from a previous transaction.
A `TxIn` is composed of
- `previous_output::Outpoint`, The previous outpoint being spent
- `signature_script::Vector{UInt8}`, which satisfies the conditions placed in
the outpointâ€™s pubkey script. Should only contain data pushes
- `sequence::UInt32` number. Default for Bitcoin Core and almost all other
programs is `0xffffffff`
