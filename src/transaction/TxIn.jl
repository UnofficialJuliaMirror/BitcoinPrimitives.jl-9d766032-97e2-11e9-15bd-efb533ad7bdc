    TxIn

Each non-coinbase input spends an outpoint from a previous transaction.
Is is composed of
- The previous outpoint being spent
- A script-language script which satisfies the conditions placed in the
outpointâ€™s pubkey script. Should only contain data pushes
- Sequence number. Default for Bitcoin Core and almost all other programs is
`0xffffffff`
